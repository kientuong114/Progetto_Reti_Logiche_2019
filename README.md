This repo contains my submission for the 2019 Digital Circuit Design project at Politecnico di Milano.

The component required had to receive a 8-bit address as input and encode it by following the specifications in "Working-zone encoding for redcuing the energy in microprocessor address buses" by E. Musoll, T. Lang and J. Cortadella.
